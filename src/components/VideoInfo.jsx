          This online video editing software makes it easy to crop your videos
          in a matter of minutes. Upload a file, select an area, and crop the
          video to size. Also, you can choose from popular aspect ratios, such
          as 16:9, 4:3, their vertical counterparts, square, etc. This way, you
          can easily adapt videos for all social networks and their specific
          requirements. All popular formats are supported for uploading, such as
          MP4, M4V, AVI, MOV, WMV, 3GP, WEBM, and many others. You can quickly
          crop it and download the result in MP4, MKV, MOV, or a format of your
          original file.
